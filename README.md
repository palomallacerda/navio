# Navio

<img src="/cargueiro.png" alt="drawing" width="120"/>

----------------------------

**Navio** is a simple tool to create linux containers based on the namespace and cgroups features. 

The Navio creates containers, that is, **a set of processes isolated by Linux namespaces**, for example: PID to isolate the processes and Mount to isolate the file systems.

All created containers have their own **rootfs** (a "mini operating system") associated, so that a change (for example, an installation of any library) in a container does not affect others ones.

It is also possible use Cgroups to limit the amount of resources that each container can use.

### Why?
Just for science, do not use this code in production :satisfied:

## Available Images

| Image| version| size |
| ---- | -----| ------|
| alpine|  v3.11| 2.7M|
| busybox| v4.0| 1.5M|
| ubuntu| v20.04| 90M|

## [Namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces)

what the processes can see

- [x] UTS - isolate **hostname and domainname**

- [x] PID - isolate the **PID number space**

- [x] MNT - isolate **filesystem mount points**

## [Cgroups](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/cgroups.txt)

what the processes can use

- [x] Memory

- [x] CPU

- [x] Process numbers

## Limitations

- The network is not being isolated and is only working on the **ubuntu** image.
- The Navio does not allow containers to run in the background.
- The Navio does not limit the use of I/O

## Requirements

- **linux.** Navio's doesn't support other operational system :(
- [golang environment](https://golang.org/)
- make
- wget
- **mysql** configured with `user == root` and `passwd == root`
- some of commands (ex.: `navio build`, `navio run`, `navio rmi` and `navio exec`) must be executed with sudo privilegies.

## How to install

#### If you just want use, is very simples

``` bash
 git clone https://github.com/viniciusbds/navio.git
 cd navio
 ./install.sh
```

#### If you want compile the code before install

``` bash
 git clone https://github.com/viniciusbds/navio.git
 cd navio
 make
 ./install.sh
```

#### To run all unit tests, type

``` bash
 cd /path/to/project/navio
 sudo make unit-tests
```

#### To uninstall

``` bash
 cd navio
 ./uninstall.sh
```
  
## Example Commands

`navio images`

`sudo navio create alpine sh --name mycontainer`

`navio containers`

```
ID	   NAME	   	   IMAGE  	COMMAND  	STATUS

14806622   mycontainer     alpine  	sh    		Stopped

```

`sudo navio exec 14806622 sh` 

...

`sudo navio create busybox sh`

`sudo navio create ubuntu /bin/bash --name python3apps`
